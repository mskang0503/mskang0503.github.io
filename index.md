I am a Software Engineer at [Meta](https://www.metacareers.com/), building privacy-preserving ML/AI systems at scale. Prior to joining Meta, I was a Research Scientist and the technical lead of the Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) algorithm and workload team in the Security & Privacy Research (SPR) group at [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html).
My major research topics are privacy-preserving ML/AI and lattice-based cryptography, but I am broadly interested in all aspects of mathematical problems derived from them. 

I completed my PhD in 2021 at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html) (SNU), where I was advised by [Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/). In 2015, I graduated with Highest Honors from SNU where I majored in Mathematical Sciences.


## News and Upcoming Events

- The paper [[KKS+24]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-63393-1) entitled "Harnessing the potential of shared data in a secure, inclusive, and resilient manner via multi-key homomorphic encryption" was published at [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/srep/).  

- The paper [[BCC+24]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/463.pdf) entitled “Security Guidelines for Implementing Homomorphic Encryption” was uploaded to ePrint Archive. We provide an updated LWE parameter tables with 128-bit security and functional parameters per each FHE scheme that can be adopted directly to the implementation.  

- The paper [[KWK+24]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/707) entitled "Towards a Polynomial Instruction Based Compiler for Fully Homomorphic Encryption Accelerators" was uploaded to eprint Archive, which introduces a new instruction set called P-ISA for a general FHE accelerator. 

- The paper [[DKMS23]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/112.pdf) entitled "Faster Amortized FHEW bootstrapping using Ring Automorphisms" was accepted to [PKC 2024](https://pkc.iacr.org/2024/). 

- The paper [[AAB+23]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1462.pdf) entitled "High-precision RNS-CKKS on fixed but smaller word-size architectures: theory and application" was accepted to [WAHC 2023](https://homomorphicencryption.org/workshops-wahc23/). 

- The paper [[KLSS23]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/623.pdf) entitled "Toward Practical Lattice-based Proof of Knowledge from Hint-MLWE" was accepted to [CRYPTO 2023](https://crypto.iacr.org/2023/).
