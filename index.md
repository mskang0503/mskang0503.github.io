I am an AI Research Fellow in the Center for AI and Natural Science at Korea Institute of Advanced Study (KIAS). My major research topics are fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and its applications to private-preserving machine learning (PPML) and private AI.

I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences (specializing in Cryptography) from Seoul National University under the supervision of [Prof. Jung Hee Cheon](https://web.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/)

## News and Upcoming Events

- [Mar 2026] I joined the Center for AI and Natural Sciences at KIAS as an AI Research Fellow.

- [Feb 2026] I received my Ph.D. from Seoul National University.

- [Dec 2025] The paper [[CKP26]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/720.pdf) entitled "Towards Lightweight CKKS: On Client Cost Efficiency" was accepted to ACM ASIACCS 2026.

<!-- - The paper [[KKS+24]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-63393-1) entitled "Harnessing the potential of shared data in a secure, inclusive, and resilient manner via multi-key homomorphic encryption" was published at [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/srep/).  

- The paper [[BCC+24]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/463.pdf) entitled “Security Guidelines for Implementing Homomorphic Encryption” was uploaded to ePrint Archive. We provide an updated LWE parameter tables with 128-bit security and functional parameters per each FHE scheme that can be adopted directly to the implementation.  

- The paper [[KWK+24]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/707) entitled "Towards a Polynomial Instruction Based Compiler for Fully Homomorphic Encryption Accelerators" was uploaded to eprint Archive, which introduces a new instruction set called P-ISA for a general FHE accelerator.

- The paper [[AAB+23]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1462.pdf) entitled "High-precision RNS-CKKS on fixed but smaller word-size architectures: theory and application" was accepted to [WAHC 2023](https://homomorphicencryption.org/workshops-wahc23/). 

- The paper [[KLSS23]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/623.pdf) entitled "Toward Practical Lattice-based Proof of Knowledge from Hint-MLWE" was accepted to [CRYPTO 2023](https://crypto.iacr.org/2023/).  -->

<!---
- Intel HERACLES, a revolutionary HW accelerator for lattice-based FHE, has been introduced at [GOMACTech 2023](https://www.gomactech.net/2023/).


- The paper [[KHB+21]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240547122100288X) about "secure genotype imputation based on HE" has been published in [Cell Systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/cell-systems). This is a joint work of [iDASH 2019](http://www.humangenomeprivacy.org/2019/) Track 2 winner teams (TFHE-Chimera, SNU, EPFL), UTHealth and Microsoft Research.
